As of 28 February 2024, there are two projects in this directory. They are hosted on Bitbucket and linked to this project as git submodules. This was doen for a few reasons...
1) to learn about submodules
2) To learn about pushing to seperate remotes
3) to learn about using Atlasian products. This project has been pushed to a Bitbucket instance, and I (sorta) use Jira et all to track the tasks for this project.

If you would like to see the code for these projects, the URLs are as follows:

HTTPY: https://bitbucket.org/mailbox-jm192/httpy/src/httpy/
TFTPY: https://bitbucket.org/mailbox-jm192/tftpy/src/tftpy/
