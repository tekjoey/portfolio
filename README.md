# Portfolio
I created this repository primarily to showcase my abilities with various programing languages, as well as with git/GitHub. Most of the work I have done with programing/scripting has been one-off projects or tutorials that I had no reason to publish, but that then means I have no way of showcasing my abilities. So this repository will be a collection of various small projects that hopefully will display my abilities.  

## Experience
All of the technologies listed are ones that I started learning on my own.
The aproximate dates I started learning the following technologies:
- Python: 2016
- PowerShell: 2022
- Bash: 2022
- Ansible: 2023
- Go: 2024

## Directories:
Each programing language will have its own directory. Under each will be subirectories for various projects.
- the `basic` subdirectory will have very simple projects; things like `hello world`, simple calculators, or other such beginner projects.
- the `projecteuler` subdirectory contains my solutions for the problems listed on projectwuler.net. These are mathematical problems.
