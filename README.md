# Portfolio
I created this repository primarily to showcase my abilities with various programing languages, as well as with git/GitHub. Most of the work I have done with programing/scripting has been one-off projects or tutorials that I had no reason to publish, but that then means I have no way of showcasing my abilities. So this repository will be a collection of various small projects that hopefully will display my abilities.  

## Experience:
All of the technologies listed are ones that I started learning on my own.
The aproximate dates I started learning the following technologies:
- Python: 2016
- PowerShell: 2022
- Bash: 2022
- Ansible: 2023
- Go: 2024

## Directories:
Each programing language will have its own directory. Under each will be subirectories for various projects.
- the `basic` subdirectory will have very simple projects; things like `hello world`, simple calculators, or other such beginner projects.
- the `projecteuler` subdirectory contains my solutions for the problems listed on projecteuler.net. These are mathematical problems. 

## Misc:
The `LA` in a commit message denote that the commit regards something that I `learned about` for the first time
- e.g. the commit message "LA varables and types" means that I "Learned about variables and types"

## Contributing:
Pull requests will be denied as this is a showcase of my solo work. 
Feel free to fork this repository, or use it for your own learning/training.
