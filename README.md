# Portfolio
I created this repository primarily to showcase my abilities with various programing languages. as well as with git/GitHub. Most of the work I have done with programing/scripting has been one-off projects or tutorials that I had no reason to publish, but that then means i have no way of showcasing my abilities. So this repository will be a collection of various small projects that hopefully will display my abilities.
